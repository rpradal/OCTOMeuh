> OCTOMeuh helps you make the maximum speech duration per participant observed during your stand-up meetings. You juste have to define a max speech duration and the app will warn you when the time is elapsed with a delightful "Moooooo".

> Moreover, if you think that the meeting is going out of control, you can flip your smartphone at anytime, as you could do with a real 
moo-box, to make the mooing ring out and re-establish the order immediately !

The app is available on [GooglePlay](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.octo.mob.octomeuh)
